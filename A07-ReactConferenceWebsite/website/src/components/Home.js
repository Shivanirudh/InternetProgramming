                        The Department of Computer Science & Engineering is proud to conduct and organize the <b><em>IFIP Event - 4th International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science</em></b> on March 18-20, 2021.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The conference provides an opportunity for the researchers, engineers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss and address the experimental, theoretical work and methods in solving problems related to data science. Also to share their experience and exchange their ideas in the field of Data Science and Computational Intelligence. This conference will be useful for professionals working in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and predictive modeling. This conference aimed to have expert talks, young researchers presentations, short papers and posters.Accepted papers that are presented at the conference will be included in the conference proceedings and published in the <b>Springer IFIP AICT</b> (Advances in Information and Communication Technology) series.
